## About The Massacre
The CIA stormed Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington on April 2, 2023 (guesstimate) after blocking all three exits, diverting calls to 911, and killed everyone inside during the Sunday morning service. The victims were beheaded and their bodies chemically cremated in the baptismal.

The altar, lectern, piano and organ were removed and the choir stands were partially removed due to excessive bloodstains. The pews affixed to the rear wall were placed at the front of the church facing the wrong way, a new altar and lectern built. The CIA hired a realtor and he hired actors to produce videos to sell the church's building and property.

In early May, Kelvin Williams, was told of the event and proceeded tell others on Twitter.  When he checked verified the address of the church with Google he found his memory off by one and found the denomination and name of his church had changed.  He found a _Mount Calvary **Missionary** Baptist Church_ at an address which would be directly across the street on Facebook.  The address reported according to Apple Maps is the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Cemetery.

Reviewing photos and videos of the _Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church_ did in fact show the interior of his Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  The exterior photo on the Facebook page showed Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  Williams and his church were never Missionary Baptist.  Williams thinks the name change is because he works directly for the Creator performing missions and has stated this to the CIA on several occassions.

Williams immediately noticed a wrecked church in the videos and did not recognize anyone or any of the practices in the church's services and decided to write a [letter](Correspondence/20230506-LetterToMCBC.pdf).

Williams received a [response](Correspondence/20230506-ResponseToKEW.pdf) the same day.

The _word soup_ in the [response](Correspondence/20230506-ResponseToKEW.pdf) horrified him, the lack of concern by his family member and pastor about the loss of his mother and sister also confirmed it was not his pastor or church that responded.

The charade church retained an attorney which sent Williams a [_Cease and Desist_](20230526-CeaseAndDesistToKEW.HEIC) to which Williams [responded](20230629-ResponseToCeaseAndDesist.pdf).
