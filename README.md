## About The Massacre
The CIA stormed Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington on April 2 after blocking all three exits, diverting calls to 911, and killed everyone inside during the Sunday morning service. The victims were beheaded and their bodies chemically cremated in the baptismal.
The altar, lectern, piano and organ were removed and the choir stands were partially removed due to excessive bloodstains. The pews affixed to the rear wall were placed at the front of the church facing the wrong way, a new altar and lectern built. The CIA hired a realtor and he hired actors to produce videos to sell the church's building and property.
