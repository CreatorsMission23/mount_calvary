# We've moved!

The Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation and all future maintenance of this document repository and its contents have been placed into the hands of the SotC as a task for #Mission23.

The SotC were given additional tasks to complete during #Mission23, the new tasks are all a direct result of the ongoing massacre that started and continues at the instruction of the CIA with apparent blessings from the United States federal government (as evidenced by their NSLs).

## SotC Wiki

The MCBCMF website project is now being handled by the SotC, you can find out about it and other projects they're working on on their Wiki at [here](https://SotC.wiki) where you can find all the information and correspondence related to the massacre, the memorial foundation, etc. the servants have received or handled.

## NSLs

To all of those handling a NSL and have been sent here to disconnect or destroy what is here...  Check the Wiki linked above, read that, read the letters, view the pictures and then you'll see why this is a threat to national security.  Tell everyone.
