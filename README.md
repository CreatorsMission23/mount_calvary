#Emergency- Save a Life!


effective: 8-22-23 14:33 EDT until: removed 

We need your assistance in reaching law enforcement in Kentucky. There is a Stingray in operation here in Riverdale I cannot trust I’m talking to the law enforcement in Kentucky.

Please call Lexington KY Police (I cannot trust my Google results to provide you a number) and KY State Police in Frankfort ONLY—they will advise you to call Richmond or LexPD but let them know I am requesting the call and only them.

The address is Mount Calvary Baptist Church. 4742 Todds Rd, Lexington, KY. Lives may be in peril, they can enter!

I need them to send a FEW officers, I need dispatch to check on them every other minute until they’ve said it’s clear.

This is the CIA backed up by the FBI, they can only trust a true Kentuckian. But we may be “brother against brother” again.

I am in Atlanta. I am the pastor of the church. There is no service going on. Regardless of what they see, if they see a hearse they need to call for backup immediately.

***

Pray. See if you should. The Supreme switchboard operator will control the flow of calls. Go on what you feel after praying about it.

# We've moved!

The Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation and all future maintenance of this document repository and its contents have been placed into the hands of the SotC as a task for #Mission23.

The SotC were given additional tasks to complete during #Mission23, the new tasks are all a direct result of the ongoing massacre that started and continues at the instruction of the CIA with apparent blessings from the United States federal government (as evidenced by their NSLs).

## SotC Wiki

The MCBCMF website project is now being handled by the SotC, you can find out about it and other projects they're working on on their Wiki at [here](https://SotC.wiki) where you can find all the information and correspondence related to the massacre, the memorial foundation, etc. the servants have received or handled.

## NSLs

To all of those handling a NSL and have been sent here to disconnect or destroy what is here...  Check the Wiki linked above, read that, read the letters, view the pictures and then you'll see why this is a threat to national security.  Tell everyone.
