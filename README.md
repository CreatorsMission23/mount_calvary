## UPDATE
Just moments ago I made a PDF from a, I guess, Apple proprietary HEIC format of a Cease and Desist that you needed to know about. Literally a few seconds after the commit updating the read me I received a knock at the door, and the officer handed me this [order of protection](Correspondence/20230731-ReceivedOOP.pdf). If I had a social media account that wasnt censored already, Id use more colorful language. 


Do you know what you get whej atheist actors running a church try to stop a family member from raising hell about his murdered loved ones? [Baptism pools](Photos/PetitionersStatement.png) and long deceaeed grandfathers of the victim filing for protective orders. Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams has a doctorate in Divinity, he would have never signed anything with a "baptism pool" he would have written baptismal if someone else had written it. 

He knows how to baptize too. But I guess [this is how you actually do it in a baptism pool](Photos/Baptism.JPG). New folka in an old church. 

## About The Massacre
The CIA stormed Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington on April 2, 2023 after blocking all three exits, diverting calls to 911, and killed everyone inside during the Sunday morning service. The victims were beheaded and their bodies chemically cremated in the baptismal.

The altar, lectern, piano and organ were removed and the choir stands were partially removed due to excessive bloodstains. Pews originally affixed to the rear wall were placed at the front of the church facing the wrong way, a new altar and lectern built. The CIA hired a realtor and he hired actors to produce videos to sell the church's building and property.

In early May, Kelvin Williams, was told of the event and proceeded tell others on Twitter.  When he checked verified the address of the church with Google he found his memory off by one and found the denomination and name of his church had changed.  He found a _Mount Calvary **Missionary** Baptist Church_ at an address which would be directly across the street on Facebook.  The address reported according to Apple Maps is the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Cemetery.

Reviewing photos and videos of the _Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church_ did in fact show the interior of his Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  The exterior photo on the Facebook page showed Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  Williams and his church were never Missionary Baptist.  Williams thinks the name change is because he works directly for the Creator performing missions and has stated this to the CIA on several occassions.

Williams immediately noticed a wrecked church in the videos and did not recognize anyone or any of the practices in the church's services and decided to write a [letter](Correspondence/20230506-LetterToMCBC.pdf) to the church's pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams.  Williams received a [response](Correspondence/20230506-ResponseToKEW.pdf) the same day.

The _word soup_ in the [response](Correspondence/20230506-ResponseToKEW.pdf) horrified him, the lack of concern by his family member and pastor about the loss of his mother and sister also confirmed it was not his pastor or church that responded.  Williams has stated that Felix Williams (the pastor) would have called or visited immediately, if everything were fine he'd at least suggest psychiatric help as he's done for others in the past. Williams also noted the logo at the top of the response depicted his church, with a choir and the choir stands NOT wrecked as he detailed in his letter.

The charade church retained an attorney which sent Williams a [_Cease and Desist_](Correspondence/20230526-CeaseAndDesist.pdf) to which Williams [responded](20230629-ResponseToCeaseAndDesist.pdf), he made sure to tell the lawyer to have a _"Blessed day"_ (translation: "Fuck You") the way his mother would.

The videos posted on Facebook are all made my atheist actors in Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  When the CIA learned that a church is not owned by the pastor but its members, and Williams objected to any property transfers the CIA began baptizing individuals to make them members.  But the baptisms are [just wrong](Photos/Baptism.JPG).  Williams believes that the CIA hired actors that resemble his actual family members, [Mike & Cassandra Richardson and the children of his cousin Cameron Richardson](Photos/BaptismFamily.JPG).  The CIA has parked outside of Williams' apartment at Legacy two vehicles that are owned by Mike and Cameron Richardson.

Williams believes the church massacre is part of an ongoing effort to erase his entire family.  Partially because of the way the CIA killed a large group of his family in Sandy Hook, TN, a large family farm, where they destroyed another church and disinterred everyone in his family's graveyard.  The CIA irradiated his family living on the farm during a flyover operation.  Patricia Ann Crawley is the child that is the result of a Rogers (of the West Sheepneck Road Rogers family) and a Crawley (of the Crawley Hill Crawleys) hookup.  Williams is **intentionally** vague about his grandparents due to an ongoing effort to steal everything and individuals unable to answer some questions required to take control of trust funds that include DuPont Chemical.  Prince Rogers Nelson is a cousin of Williams, and was used by the Creator also.  The Creator likes using families.  

Williams is currently living out the lyrics in _Sign of the Times_ at _Legacy at Riverdale_ in Riverdale Clayton County, GA.  Located behind the Chick-fil-A Dwarf House on 85.  His saga began when he tried a formula, provided to him by the Creator, on a friend named Ken Mabry who **had** HIV and his next viral load test came back "TARGET NOT FOUND."

Gilead Sciences placed a contract hit on Mabry and Williams.  When the CIA failed to kill Williams, they caused him to lose his home at 590 Tahoma Drive in Sandy Springs, Georgia.  Williams lived with several different people over the years before landing at Motel 6 at 2572 Candler Road in Decatur, GA.

While at Motel 6, attempts on Williams' life were tried around the clock everyday.  Williams established a church for the safety of anyone who needed to escape Motel 6 including defectors.  The church was not religious, more of a SEPARATION of church and state, although the CIA is not state.

Williams was awarded a one year free apartment at Legacy at Riverdale in Riverdale, GA.  But the attempts on his life only increased.  Williams believes Legacy, as the name would imply, is a place for the dead or dying--at the hands of the "Company" as they are known there.

Williams did notice that there are an extremely high number of "evictions."  But the evictions were unlike normal non-payment of rent evictions where the property is placed outside the unit, almost everyday of the month you can find individiuals dumping entire apartments at the back of the property.  Worse, Williams witnessed people moving in and out within the same month.

The swimming pool was never open, but suddenly after Williams started sharing how bodies were disposed of at Mount Calvary Baptist Church (in the baptismal, which the CIA joked about his description--[a small pool](Screenshots/BaptismalJoke.JPG)--on Facebook using the account of one of Williams' missing friends, Stuart Bruner) the pool at Legacy was drained.  Williams cannot understand why the pool, which was never opened, was resurfaced when a burned out building could be fixed aesthetically for less cost and improve the look of the property.

When the CIA feared that too many people now knew about the chemical cremation any Williams's "Company" provided residence, they began [resurfacing the pool](Photos/LegacyPoolResurfacing.JPG) at the same time they lstarted the [baptisms](Photos/Baptism.JPG) at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.  Williams thinks this may be the "crumbling wall" sung about by Vandaveer.  The now missing and impersonated Mark Charles Heigdinger of Vandaveer is Williams' one-time best friend.  Williams states that the Creator used Vandaveer to help Williams during a rather dark period in his life, Vandaveer's Divide and Conquer album details his Aunt Mary of Sandy Hook, TN, and her life with Annie whom befriended her after her husband died of COVID-19 ("Resurrection Mary"), Mount Calvary Baptist Church and the Kentucky State Police's finding of bones on the church's property and Williams' attempts to ring the fire bell ("A Mighty Leviathan of Old"), and the Creator's opinion of and plan for some of the players in what is definitely no game ("The Sound and the Fury").  The Vandaveer's  "Dig Down Deep" begins the next chapter of Williams' life with his partner--whom the CIA couldn't kill either.

Practically every missing person in this tragedy has been chemically cremated in their bathtub and bones ground which makes them look like gravel. 

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the massacre

1.  Why did no one escape?

Williams has provided this hand-drawn [floorplan](Diagrams/MCBCFloorplan.JPG) of the church.  During service, people can enter the back of the church through the unlocked exterior doors to the men's and women's lounges without any detection or raising alarm with any congregant as the doors to the sanctuary are closed.

2. Why did no one call for help?

The CIA utilized COWs (Cellular [tower] on Wheels), which are used by mobile network providers in natural disasters and after accidents that damage a cellular tower.  The CIA parked two within a half mile on either direction of the church causing all mobile phones in the area to connect to them.  Calls were then diverted to either busy signals or fake 911 call takers.

3. Why did no one outside the church notice the massacre?

Williams believes the closest neighbors were likely killed.  The area around the church is not heavily populated or traveled. [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/7nxmwK1AsSyhDiXB6) of 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, KY.
