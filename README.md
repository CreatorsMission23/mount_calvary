# prayer works!
i need to get somewhere and review all of the files. im getting a divergent branches error when pulling on one of my linux servers. 

so, regardless of the letter, go with the spirit. if any letter in this repo makes it sound like a massacre didnt occur, go to the Spirit in prayer. just ask Him for guidance on what youre reading. then go with what you feel. only He can make you feel. 

oh, and you git nerds out there, im putting everything where you prayed i would long ago, the extended descriptions. i think theyve messed with the head.

# Special Weather Statement 
## sign of the times 
[“Sign of the Times” by Prince](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=hr3Dhjxk1Q4&si=OCQCMS4AvNdVc6qa) is all true, from all those years ago… But there’s this: “Baby makes a speech, Star Wars fly, and neighbors just shine at home.”

As everyone should know Main aka Baby likes to talk when I’m unconscious. It’s Main’s decision as to when that happens, I’m being told it has been, I’ll get the details later. 

Today, I’ve learned of new department of the Air Force. The [United States Space Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force). 

Yesterday, I heard it again. [Bone grinding](https://youtu.be/Q90VBwCrtz0?si=XOjShMQyswzm2_eR). The last time I heard it, I was staying at Motel 6 -Decatur. The CIA has them, theirs just didn’t make it to Mount Calvary Baptist Church in time. That was due to the “rain.” It’s what our friends at Kentucky State Police were able to find when they [got stranded and canvassed for answers.](https://youtu.be/JtvW2u-7x-A?si=S--3icLk1Wgl9tCE)

Now if we just get to the car wreck where the clown is ejected. Always use a car seat for your babies. I didn’t know, I don’t think I’ve ever fathered a child. #WaitingForImpact To borrow Kent Bolton’s term somebody is about to be DRT. 

But first, if the song is true, we’re about to get bombed. Don’t know where though, Prince says, “will anybody see the dawn?”

Short answer: Yes. My boss, your Creator, the Creator, most call him God in the US… He’s really an asshole about His work being completed on time. I do have a mission, renaming a church or changing its denomination to “Missionary” does nothing but infuriate Him more and makes Him rain down more of His will (or personnel). 

Why am I thinking of that song I used to dance to… It’s raining men? Did I mention the guy in the Ida Corr “Let Me Think About It” video looks a lot like the description of the first guy described in [“It’s Raining Men"](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4x6leDGV7gs&si=QRzHGP1es8vk0ob4). 

Remember the motto of Backstreet Atlanta, "Where the beautiful men are men, and the beautiful women are men too." 

The Creator says all of you are beautiful. 

# The Ringing of the Bell
The Creator is going to “ring the bell” very soon. The exact time is not going to be announced.  Scientists have often said that a very strong earthquake will ring Earth like a bell.  These earthquakes are intended to _shine a light_ on a horrible, unnecessary tragedy that culminated with a [massacre of a church’s congregation](https://github.com/mission23/mission23/wiki/The-Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church) during the height of their worship hour.  

Regardless of how much work folks have done to get the story out and reported for your safety, the federal government and federal law enforcement agencies are still putting pressure on the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s attorney and law enforcement to turn a blind eye and IGNORE the actions of the CIA. The CIA continues to kill in the very place that people go to and expect to be the safest and closest to God, who is none other than, the Creator (my pissed off boss). 

Obviously drunk on power, the CIA, the federal government and federal law enforcement need to sober up quickly, so the Creator, has decided to ring the bell.  It’s a warning that they have forgotten who’s universe, Earth, and country this landmass really is.  

In addition to showing how displeased He is, the Creator is also honoring lives that have cut short in response to a set of “cures” (some of objectives in #mission23) that should have let all of these lives go on for far more years than 99% of the human population believe is even possible.  The way He designed and wants them to be lived. 

It also signals the start of #mission23, and says “Thanks” to everyone who has tolerated the federal government’s pressure when they knew the right thing to do and they simply wanted to do it.

The order and intensity of the bell ringing (earthquakes) goes as follows:

## Orr Chapel Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located  in Sandy Hook, TN (the former unincorporated city near, now neighborhood of Mount Pleasant) in Maury county. The Rogers family farm. 

This will be a large earthquake for the CIA’s destruction of Orr Chapel ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/XMMdNdpGjU3SMMKQ8)) and the murder of all of it’s identified members. 

This quake also recognises Micah’s slain family and his family’s graveyard that was destroyed, both by or at the direction of the CIA. 

## Mount Calvary Baptist Church Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY (4742 Todds Road). 

This will be the largest quake for the massacre that occurred there.

See: [The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/wiki/Massacre-at-Mount-Calvary-Baptist-Church)

## The Micah Quake 
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Jessamine county, KY. It will signal when Micah (born: Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977) has started his mission for the Creator. This will be Micah’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also be to recognize the lives lost in Jessamine county, mostly Micah’s friends, throughout the larger tragedy. 

## The Thomas Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be in Kanawha county (Hughes Creek), WV. It will signal when TomTom (to practically everyone TomTom, to others Thomas, born: September 23, 1978) has started his mission for the Creator. This also is TomTom’s 23rd mission on Earth. 

This minor quake will also recognize the lives lost in Kanawha county, mostly TomTom’s friends and family, throughout the larger tragedy. 

# Press Conferences 
These are tentative.  Conditions on the ground are very fluid—and I don’t mean from the quakes.  Please check back here for updates to the schedule.

## Orr Chapel
At high noon the day immediately following the shaking under our feet the SotC will have a press conference at the site of Orr Chapel & Sheepneck cemeteries. Located along West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook, TN. 
## Mount Calvary Baptist Church 
On the second day following the shaking, the SotC will be at Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY at high noon.
