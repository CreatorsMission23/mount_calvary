# MCBCMassacre
This repository holds all code (html, css and js) and other assets (pdfs, images, audio/video recordings) for the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation's primary website.

The purpose of the site, like the foundation, is to honor the lives lost during the massacre, preserve the church's property and share its history so that this massacre shall not be forgotten nor repeated. 

The site will also serve as clearinghouse for information on this event.
