This is a Facebook & Twitter replacement since we know for certain that we are being banned (by Facebook) and muted/suppressed (by Twitter).  This will be picking up where @ASOTC23, @kelvinewilliams & @kelvinatlanta left off.

Hey it is Micah. The earthquake epicenters have been updated. Sandy Hook, TN in Maury county will be the first. This is for the church which was on West Sheepneck Rd. 

Im going to be thinking of my family--the Rogers family (thats me), the Crawley family (thats me too), and our relatives they forced out even though their homes were forever--the graveyard next to the church they destroyed firat to make way for the new development.

Due to a rather low-tech hack, I now have two bricked iPhones.  Someone changed my iCloud password, then changed my passcode, so within a day I had my phones go "iPhone Unavailable."  Because of iCloud password change I'm unable to simply erase without encountering Activation Lock.  If anyone is trying to reach me, you can text me TEMPORARILY at â€ª(678) 720-8119.  I can receive voice calls, but I need to be waiting for it, one wrong move and I cannot call back or retrieve voicemail.  I recommend e-mail: kelvineugenewilliams@outlook.com.

Calling all Vandaveer fans!   Please check your streaming services to see if Rose's voice has been replaced with another performer's.  Specifically on Divide & Conquer and Dig Down Deep.

We are either in an NSA walled garden or Twitter has changed its logo..
Probably a walled garden.  They need us to stay very hidden, if they can't kill us and the message.
Please keep sharing the link to the repo.  Keep it up until you see this on the evening news.
