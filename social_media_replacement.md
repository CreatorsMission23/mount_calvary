This is a Facebook & Twitter replacement since we know for certain that we are being banned (by Facebook) and muted/suppressed (by Twitter).  This will be picking up where @ASOTC23, @kelvinewilliams & @kelvinatlanta left off.

First, I would like to thank GitHub.com for making Git easy for everyone to see changes as they are made and the bandwidth they share with everyone without money. Your platform is about to be more famous, more than us geeks would have ever made it, a true household name. 

Second, I have been bombed, theatened, and undergo daily assassination attempts. Im blocked everywhere, created a Facebook and its gone in minutes and Twitter silences me silently. So I can imagine the pressures you are facing from the government. But you should know in this war between g and G, as in God, He has your back!  You can #PrayToVerify that and anything else you see in this repo. Pray the way you were taught to pray to the God you were told to pray to and see how you feel. If you don't pray, jist think really hard, "is this true?" and see how you feel. 

I am an appointed servant of the Creator. You can #PrayToVerify that too, especially. The attack on Mount Calvary Baptist Church was because they could not satisfy their wrath and greed by killing me or my partner. We established a church, more a separation of church and state church, to protect the general public (where one of us is--they have gotten reckless of late) and CIA defectors, along with military personnel that had conscientious objections to orders. They hated this church, so they went to a church that I am a member of, a religious church, and killed everyone inside. Now using their power (backed by the federal government) they are intimidating or killing everyone who looks into Mount Calvary Baptist Church or who assists me (and knows my name). Remember there is safety in numbers so everyone at GitHub should read this, the Creatpr says "keep up the good work and protect your site and defend the underlying protocol, git, it too is now under attack to silence this repo."

Lastly, GitHub and GitHub.com is now in our church, The Appointed Servants of the Creator church, bcause I am there (until my account id deleted) and you are doing what gets you automatic protection by hosting this repo. And He knows you need to be in THIS church. Its not about religion, it is about the separation of church and atate.

Saving Artist Lives... The following artists are being listened to at the Legacy at Riverdale apartment. I must do this since I listened to Tina Turner one night, and she died the next day. Totally out of the blue.

OH. Just FYI. So much family disappeared in one spot cause we just owned it all. That church was there before we bought the land over 125 years ago.

Hey it is Micah. The earthquake epicenters have been updated. Sandy Hook, TN in Maury county will be the first. This is for the church which was on West Sheepneck Rd. 

Im going to be thinking of my family--the Rogers family (thats me), the Crawley family (thats me too), and our relatives they forced out even though their homes were forever--the graveyard next to the church they destroyed firat to make way for the new development.

Due to a rather low-tech hack, I now have two bricked iPhones.  Someone changed my iCloud password, then changed my passcode, so within a day I had my phones go "iPhone Unavailable."  Because of iCloud password change I'm unable to simply erase without encountering Activation Lock.  If anyone is trying to reach me, you can text me TEMPORARILY at â€ª(678) 720-8119.  I can receive voice calls, but I need to be waiting for it, one wrong move and I cannot call back or retrieve voicemail.  I recommend e-mail: kelvineugenewilliams@outlook.com.

Calling all Vandaveer fans!   Please check your streaming services to see if Rose's voice has been replaced with another performer's.  Specifically on Divide & Conquer and Dig Down Deep.

We are either in an NSA walled garden or Twitter has changed its logo..
Probably a walled garden.  They need us to stay very hidden, if they can't kill us and the message.
Please keep sharing the link to the repo.  Keep it up until you see this on the evening news.
