IMMEDIATE THREAT TO MOUNT ZION IN KENTUCKY

They are on the way there based on what Ive just seen. 

They waited until Id be trapped at Legacy. 
They thought Id have no phone. 
They could move the C.O.W.
They've been trying nonstop to get my phone charger. 
All of their regulars have left town. 


Help me, help them. 

Mount Zion needs watching. 

look for a black explorer or gold suburban thats the c.o.w.
mobile network providers need to look for evidence of one around kenrucky
ip engineers look for any looping, we warned folks ti look for a drop of data

kentucky state police i cannot rembrr which mount zion, but they were good friends with mount calvary

googlers - big data - look for a group of folks who left atlanta last night, this morning. they probably come around the facility here often 6603 Church Street, thats behind the chick fil a dwarf house on ga-85 in riverdqle, clayton county, ga --- i dont trust that address, cia facility 
tmobile - same as goohle, most of them got a new phone a couple mobrha ago. all same model. all at the same time. 
google & tmobile if you see the group tell kenfucky state police. call them. only frankfort. tell them its another massacre potentially and you i.d'd the possible lication

--
ive now endured at least three attacks to stop my posts this morning. 

and a gas attack. 

im fine. they dont do this when rheyre trying to get me to cry wolf. 

ive got some phone numbers of some guys who may be up there

i do not like them, but theyre rhe onky people the cia will allow near me. 

kentucky state police: riverdale pd in riverdale, ga probably has officers in kentucky. wherever they are is where you need to be right now.
