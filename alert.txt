Monday Alert

A CIA pair is here doing everything to get my phone. One mentioned he
had to work tomorrow, and "frying chicken."

So im repeating this... They were probably getting me to cry wolf the
other day. Better safe than sorry. Never send officers alone.


I need someone to call Kentucky State Police, and you must speak with
someone in Frankfort!

Tell them that I would feel better about all of the increased acrivity
around me (from my minders who refuse to leave), they are often an
indicator of things underway. I heard one of them mention "working" at
wedding today.

I do not think its at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, I think its at her
best friend, Mount Zion.

Tell them I could be paranoid, but, listen to:
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=6EkyHMwAFSE&si=5BGlqxzqdESZTnRd
where it begins at "with cracks in our feet."

And remember Annie has a habit of "pushing things up mighty mountainS"
there are two mighty mountains. Mount Calvary and Mount Zion.

I do not know if an AME or Baptist. I THINK its Mount Zion Baptist,
its been a while.
