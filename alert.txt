Given the early morning visit... I submitted a Crime Stoppers Report for the unauthorized photo shoot at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. I submitted it as burglary (entering the dwelling of another without their permission). 

I also mentioned my missing aunt, Emma Jean Dale, of Elizabethtown. They want viewers to believe that is her with my sister (its not Katrina either) presenting something at the pastoral anniversary. 

I also asked for increased patrols in the area since the church is closed until further notice.
