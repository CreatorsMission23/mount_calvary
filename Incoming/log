The "three amigos" (Danny, Tony, and Greg) have left going to the Riverdale library, going to meet "Chevy" she's got stuff they said. I told them to tell Annie to come back to visit. 

They left. The apartment exploded. They came back and I asked if there was a problem. I told them that would be God, their problem. Tony told me that would be a solution. I reminded him that "one man's trash is another man's treasure" so "one man's problem is another's solution/security/boss whatever."

Tony had no response.
