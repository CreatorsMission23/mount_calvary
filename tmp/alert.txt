I need someone to call Kentucky State Police, and you must speak with someone in Frankfort!

Tell them that I would feel better about all of the increased acrivity around me (from my minders who refuse to leave), they are often an indicator of things underway. I heard one of them mention "working" at wedding today.

I do not think its at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, I think its at her best friend, Mount Zion.

Tell them I could be paranoid, but, listen to: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=6EkyHMwAFSE&si=5BGlqxzqdESZTnRd where it begins at "with cracks in our feet."

And remember Annie has a habit of "pushing things up mighty mountainS" there are two mighty mountains. Mount Calvary and Mount Zion.

I do not know if an AME or Baptist. I THINK its Mount Zion Baptist, its been a while.
