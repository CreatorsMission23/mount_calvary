Still a sognificant threat increasing with each commit. It's not crime, it's my phone, "the very key" as Prince calls it.

Should SIGNED COMMITS stop, a reminder is being set to make one every 4-6 hours, if no activity in 12 hours, start the search for me in Clayton County, Georgia. If not there, try DeKalb county, then the rest of the metro ATL area.

Do not forget to check Grady, they do not mind restraining someone to a gurney in the most painful position when they have no legitimate things to charge him with, and call it medically necessary.

Do not trust booking data, I didnt appear on jail census docs the guards use for counts in the most recent arrest for days.

According to Danny, the apparent plan is to lock me out in the cold, he has my keys and my coats have disappeared. If I were to break the window, he will cut me up as this is his apartment.

Funny thing is, I have video of him breaking that very window and audio of the Riverdale PD telling me he could.
