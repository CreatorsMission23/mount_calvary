Still a sognificant threat increasing with each commit. It's not crime, it's my phone, "the very key" as Prince calls it.

Should SIGNED COMMITS stop, a reminder is being set to make one every 4-6 hours, if no activity in 12 hours, start the search for me in Clayton County, Georgia. If not there, try DeKalb county, then the rest of the metro ATL area.

Do not trust booking data, I didnt appear on jail census docs the guards use for counts in the most recent arrest for days.
