Given no one can hire me, as merely expressing interest can result in their death and has for those who interviewed me. See Fluent Stream and Genesys.

I have decided and the Creator has approved (with one condition, the business goes with Micah) a new business that will focus on the "human trafficking" problem reportedly in Atlanta.

The firm will provide infornation on tactics used, methods and entities used for body disposal, law enforcement operations that aide and abet, and the CIA which runs the whole show.

I can give tours at Legacy at Riverdale. They are not recommended, as your life will be placed in extreme danger. 

The Creator's Points of Light Project will provide detailed information on anyone who has went missing in Clayton County or when traveling through ATL.

Very inexpensive. $25 for missing individuals, only charged if a death certificate is issued by the Creator.
