I have no plans for Atlanta's gay pride. 
Normally I would be seeing DJ Paulo at Xion tonight. But he's no longer here, he is among the other friends of mine taken from us by the CIA. 

I am concerned about the venue Xion for two reasons:

1) Everybody that would be there knows Paulo's music. Paulo always spins the afterhours set at Pride. The CIA knows this. 

2) The music of Vandaveer, specifically the song "Matter of Fact" tells us that Annie Jacobsen has the habit of pushing things up mighty mountains, and doubting the greatful again. 

Mount Calvary is a mighty mountain. So is, Mount Zion... But Xion (pronounced the same) would be a very hard hill for them to climb, while trying to impersonate Paulo Gois.
