it is wednesday and it has already been an adventure. the weekend was hell too. 

i still have the clergy ring of the rev. dr. felix g. williams, iii. the cia is doing everything to kill me or steal it and my phone (the only authorized device that can update github.com). 

moments ago on the train at peachtree center station the doors opened and they sprayed something into the car. felt like metal fragments. i am ok, He is still pissed, so theyre not going to be able to kill me anytime soon. 

i wonder if He will let me die if annie gives a full confession to the world... probably not. 

yesterday i seen a katrina lookalike. while trying to get her to call her family and let them know the kind of danger she was in, target employees (read "cia operatives") came out. one claimed to be her husband, got aggressive, slapped my phone from my hand. superficial crack on the back. i do not know why he had to do that, just guessing they need to disable it quickly. im always seeing lasers hitting my screen. sometimes they make my phone dumb for a split second, He says theyre designed to kill the phone. so i can deal with the split second while it recovers, sometimes i take a few seconds after being hit. 

fyi. cia: katrina and mom lookalikes, or any family or friend, only make me madder and more determined. "enough on that for now."
