theyre actually "cloaked"
i know how to clean my lenses, theyre never dirty im just always surrounded. 
theyre just tossing photons around, and sometimes they get entangled. ask a physicist. 
thats why some light flares excessively in my photos. 
i'll upload photos in this directory to show it. 
theres a hint folks, but i bet the nerds at gatech already have better detection in the works.
