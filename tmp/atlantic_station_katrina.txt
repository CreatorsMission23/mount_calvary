I begged an pleaded for them to let her scan my phone. so she could have the info to make the right decision. i just wanted her to call her family. it always ends the same for them, death before pay. 

the "peace officer" that ran up bearing down on me, escorted me all the way off atlantic station. i told him, "you know they just killed her" or something to that effect. he replied. "thats unfortunate"
