This dog I found outside coated in poison. He finally came inside and hid in the pantry for a day. He came finally came outside. 

This dog had me confused from day two. When you hear 7 by Prince, you’ll hear me asking the Creator “Just how old?”

His teeth were razor sharp, he tore up things, and made messes all over the house. Unbeknownst to me at first, all on command by people in the house cloaked. 

After the dog left me, they projected a previous assignment on the wall of this apartment. 

The projection showed the dog eating the skin off of my friend’s face. Sheriff Kent Bolton. 

I can’t wait to destroy the CIA.
