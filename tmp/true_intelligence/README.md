The Cleric Controversy 

New CTT filed. I’m responding: Fuck the CIA

They wanna say there are two staged photos of Katie and Adam. 

I respond: Bring me Chrissi Foster, one of the Commonwealth’s Attorneys and Jill Erwin, reporter/editor with Turner. Both from Jessamine, both guests, both good friends of Katie and I. Both more truthful than the CIA. Chrissi was the photog!!! (She’s a hobbyist, see the lighting?)

Both I’m afraid… Victims of the CIA.
