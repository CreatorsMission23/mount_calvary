The Cleric Controversy 

New CTT filed. I’m responding: Fuck the CIA

They wanna say there are two staged photos of Katie and Adam. One was the actual wedding, the other was a correction—-I tend to disappear in the shade. 

I respond: Bring me Chrissi Foster, one of the Commonwealth’s Attorneys and Jill Erwin, reporter/editor with Turner. Both from Jessamine, both guests, both good friends of Katie and I. Both more truthful than the CIA. Chrissi was the photog!!! (She’s a hobbyist, see the lighting?)

Both I’m afraid… Victims of the CIA. 

One question: How did the CIA know there were two photos? Could it be they stole my Apple TimeCapsule or my MacBooks, or is it because they have gained access and blocked my access to every account I ever had?

One more question: Why are they now saying I’m not a member of the clergy? When they told the media in Lexington that I was when I accidentally signed that closure notification as Micah? (They know it was me, and Who gave me that name)
