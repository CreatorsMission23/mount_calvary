The "company" as they are known by their employees or contractors living in their "rent free" apartments at Legacy at Riverdale has begun clearing the property.

By clearing I do mean killing everyone they can. I've been through this a frw times before. 

Annie likes to bring in teams from outside to kill everyone. They meet their demise later. 

I'll post old Tweets from when I went through this at Motel 6 located at 2572 Candler Rd in Decatur.

Unfortunately, all I can do is document and hope people take heed. Law enforcement is here, they heard the screams, they always do, and they did committed the very sin that pisses my Boss off the most: sloth. 

Sloth is knowing about something, having the ability to do something, and doing nothing. 

"Tommy" has arrived. He a "phone charger" but enough on that for now.
