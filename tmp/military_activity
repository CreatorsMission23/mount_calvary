Flyover of a jet, directly over my apartment it sounded like. Definitely abnormal, nothing flies over me given the proximity to Hartsfield. Not in a "lane." Nothing but my drones, and doomsday planes, the occassional bomber, including a B2 Spirit one day (directly over my apartment).

Look it up!

side note:

I'm good. The B4-NE-1 flies above, below, around and through everything they got. Never needs refueling and can eat nukes before they cause any damage. It's from the Supreme Air Force, the Commander there just got pushed aside, critical operation, the current one, She gets so irritable and doesn't do anything but get extremely sideways when things threaten Her children. She has documented history, see the story starting at Genesis 19.

That destruction came because just ONE of Her children were in danger. Today 8 billion and
climbing children are, and too many are dying daily, some because of what He sent us to fix, too many because of the CIA and the US government and their ritual practice of the seven deadly sins. I think Ill listen to my cousin Prince's 7 now and dream about the day I can start my authorized side/pet project... Chernobyl (the new city with streets of gold--side effect of the cleanup process).
